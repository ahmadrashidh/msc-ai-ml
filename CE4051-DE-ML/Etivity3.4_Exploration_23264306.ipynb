Artificial neurons are the building blocks of artificial neural networks and it is inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neurons.\n","\n","The basic similarity between artificial neurons and biological neurons is their basic operation i.e. information processing. Both types of neurons receive inputs, computate on these inputs, and produce an output. In biological neurons, these processes involve electrical and chemical signals, leading to fire next chain of neuron if a certain threshold is reached. Artificial neurons mimic this process through mathematical operations - activation functions, which determine the output. In Artificial Neural network, it also fires the input to the next hidden layer.\n","\n","Although they are similar, the level of complexity in the biological neuron is incredible. While artificial neurons mimic the basic operation of neural process, they are highly simplified. Biological neurons are incredibly complex, with intricate dendritic structures, ion channels, and synaptic connections, allowing for a wide range of behaviors beyond the scope of artificial neurons. On contrary, Artificial neurons just use simple mathematical functions to model their activation functions.\n","\n","To say whether artificial neuron is a good model of the biological neuron, we have to contrast the goal. When the goal is to solve practical computational problems, artificial neurons have proven successful. They have revolutionized fields like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous robotics. On contrary, if the it is to understand the intricacies of brain function and neurobiology, artificial neurons fall short of being good model of biological neuron.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HaP1wkOSVq8r"}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
