> Learn a labelled data or right answers

Supervised Learning algorithms are algorithms that are trained where the "right answers" are given to the algorithm i.e. the algorithms is given dataset on which it learns some model

## Types of models:
### Regression Model
Predict continuous valued output called regression problem
Ex: price of the house based on the house area

**Methodology**: It is done by fitting a line in the graphed data which predicts the price
### Classification Model
Predicts a discrete output based on one or more features i.e. true or false OR predict categories
Ex: Breast cancer malignant or benign based on tumour size or type of cancer based on the same

Two can be combined
Ex: a combined camera-based pedestrian and vehicle detection algorithm with detect the position of the object in an image (regression) and assign it to a class (classification) - vehicle or pedestrian.

**Methodology**: This is done by finding a boundary in the graphed data that separates the dissimilar categories.
