> Old but today - state-of-the-art technique for many machine learning problems. Miming the brain

__Why Neural Networks?__
When n is large, computation becomes complex with high-order polynomial. For example, computer vision problems because of large pixel matrix.


## One Learning Algorithm Cortex
> Auditory Cortex can learn to see.

## How we represent Neural Network Model?
> Simulating neural network in the body

Dendrites - inputs
Nucleus - Hypothesis or/and activation function
Axon - Output

Layers of NN:
1. Input Layer
2. Hidden Layer(can be more than one)
3. Output Layer

If network has s<sub>j</sub> units in layer j, s<sub>j+1</sub> units in the layer j + 1, then $\theta$<sup>(j)</sup> will be of dimension s<sub>j+1</sub> x (s<sub>j</sub> + 1)
