> Arthur Samuel: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn, without being explicitly programmed

> Tom Mitchell: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Examples:
- Database Mining
- Apps that can't be programmed by hand
	- Autonomous Helicopter, Handwriting recognition, Computer Vision and most of NLP
- Self-customising programs Ex: E-commerce product recommendations
- Understanding human learning
