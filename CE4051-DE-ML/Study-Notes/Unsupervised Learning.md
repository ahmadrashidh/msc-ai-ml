Unsupervised machine learning isn't associated with the given answers learn to define structure that identify data points with characteristics
### Types:

#### Clustering

Grouping together data points of similar characteristics
Examples:
1. Taking a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.
2. Grouping news to topic based on the words in it

#### Non-clustering

Ex: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at aÂ [cocktail party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect)).

**1. Anomaly Detection**
**2. Dimensionality Reduction**
