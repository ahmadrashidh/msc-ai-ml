We can only sample frequencies up to half the sample rate(no. of samples taken per second). Any frequencies higher than this rate is aliased to lower frequencies

Aliasing can be mitigated using Low Pass Filter

Digital Spectrum is repeated with infinitely many so-called image frequencies that the aliased frequencies can also represent
