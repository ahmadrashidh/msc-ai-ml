- K nearest Neighbours
- SVM
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Neural Networks

### Metrics of Classifier

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix

### Precision and Recall

Accuracy (Ratio of correct predictions)
= Number of Correct Predictions / Total No. of Predictions
= TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN

Precision - proportion of positive predictions i..e actually correct
= TP / TP + FP

Recall - Proportion of positives correctly identified = TP / TP + FN
