A schema of defining length is brittle even if its low order. Because its likely to be broken up

Other less destructive type of crossover:
1. 1-point crossover
2. n-point crossover
	- less likely to break things up
	- more positional bias
3. Uniform crossover
	- Creating "crossover mask" - is like string defining which gene is coming from which parent
	- More likely to transmit half of genetic material
	- No positional bias
- Which is best?
	- Depends on the problem
	- Sometimes, it is better to disrupt the extremities of the individual
	- Sometimes, it is disastrous!
	- No Free Lunch
