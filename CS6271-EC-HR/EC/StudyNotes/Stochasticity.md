## Statistical Confidence
> How do you know one is better than other

that is, is Problem  A is better in Setting A compared to Setting B?

Are these two things - statistically significantly different?

Can be tested by a simple test a null hypothesis?

Null Hypothesis -> p-value called measure of confidence

### p - value
> Measure of confidence

If we choose a run at random, more sure about the result, more confidence we have on the setting for a problem
